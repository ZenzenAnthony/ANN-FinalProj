# PublicUnrest – ANN Project Implementation

This folder contains the **final implementation** of the CCS 248 Artificial Neural Networks
project for classifying levels of public unrest from social-media-style text.

All neural networks in this folder are **trained from scratch**, with no pretrained models
or external embeddings used.
