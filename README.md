# ANN Final Project – Predicting Levels of Public Unrest from Social Media Text

This repository contains our final project for **Artificial Neural Networks**, titled:

> **Predicting Levels of Public Unrest from Social Media Text: A Neural Network-Based Solution**

The goal of this project is to train a neural network **from scratch** to classify the **level of public unrest** (e.g., calm, mild, high) expressed in short online text, using the **GoEmotions** dataset as the main training source.

## 🧠 Project Overview

People react to policies, prices, and socio-economic events through social media posts and comments. These reactions range from calm acceptance to strong anger and calls for protest.

Manually monitoring all of this text is impossible at scale, so the project focuses on:

- Taking **text input** (Reddit-style comments)
- Mapping detailed **emotion labels** to **3 unrest levels**
- Converting text to **numeric features** (TF-IDF)
- Training a **feedforward neural network (MLP)** to predict the unrest level

The project **does not use any pretrained models** (e.g., BERT, GPT); the neural network is trained from scratch.
